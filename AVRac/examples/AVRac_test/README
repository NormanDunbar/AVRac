This example demonstrates the Analog Comparator comparing 3.3V on
pin AIN0/D6/PD6 with whatever voltage is on pin AIN1/D7/PD7. That pin
is connected to a potentiometer and can vary from 0 to 5V.

If AIN1/D7/PD7 is less than 3.3V the LED will light.

If AIN1/D7/PD7 is equal or more than 3.3V the LED will extinguish.

Enjoy!
