This example demonstrates the Analog Comparator comparing 1.1V from
the internal bandgap voltage reference with whatever voltage is on
pin AIN1/D7/PD7. That pin is connected to a potentiometer and can
vary from 0 to 5V.

If AIN1/D7/PD7 is less than 1.1V the LED will light.

If AIN1/D7/PD7 is equal or more than 1.1V the LED will extinguish.

Enjoy!
